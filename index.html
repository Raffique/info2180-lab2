                            I started uwi initially as an Computer engineering student but then took a year and a half break from school to work. 
                            Upon returning to school i switched to the Electronics and computer science bsc due to finance reasons and thus continued my current journey to my final year at uwi.
                            It has been a a struggle for most of my university life, no mentioning i was initially a Utech student for 3 years before attending UWI.
                            There is a reason for all our struggles wether deserved or brought about not by your own doing, we must persevere and find away to do better.

                            During my time leave of absense from school i worked with a Company named Vim Enterprise Ltd ans still working with them. This comapany makes 
                            embedded systems that function as a queuing display systemt hat keeps customer in a queue buy giving physical tickets and a system that keeps tracks of customers served and display current customers calle via teeller buttons.
                            This company makes other various systems that are PA systems and simple ticketing sytems. This job has various outings all over the island on a weekly basis, so i can say i travel through all 14 parishes on a weekly basis.

                            Aside from school work, i have been involed in extra corricular activites such as the robotics club IEEE where i was previously the captain of the robotics team at UTech, 
                        attending compettion and research projects on developing robots/drones. Robotics has served to further the vision of my career in adapting to technology utilised in first world countries.
                        Utilizing technology on the same level as first world countries in Jamaica would be great however there are alot of hindrances to reaching this outcome.
                        It is too expensive to import these technology via commercial or non-commercial import.
                        The duties/taxes attached to bring these devices in jamaica hinder young minds from getting familiar with these technology on a general basis, which  doesnt promote young hobbists to develop a passion on interest in innovating inventions.
                        Jamaica struggles with technology behind the scenes, praising the little succes and inventions a few have while most are leaving to achieve such passions in technology in other countries.
                            
                        </p>
                            My small research in making a business centered around drone racing in jamaica for reacreation was unsuccesful for a first start. 
                            According to all the hindrances a spoke of lighting previously, there are not enough resources to create a profitable business centered around using quad/tri copters to race against different competitors.
                            Accounting for the damage drones would recieve, the replacment of parts and buying different models to entice interest vs the cost to charge customers didnt generate worhtwhile profits.
                            In other countries like firt world states, where most competitors have their own drones to practice before competitions and access to various commuinties that support the sport do not scale up with a seeting in Jamaica.
                            Therefore in the currrent econmic setting of Jamaica this form of business is not profitable.
